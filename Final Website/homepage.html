    <!-- Summary of Stuart with an image in the centre of the text -->
    <p> As a child, Stuart Alexander McCulley the First was known for being extremely annoying and loud-mouthed.
      Unfortunately, as time progresses, things have yet to change.  Stuart is a very well rounded person,
      able to practice and excel at many talents (However the whole "athletic" side of life still elude him). </p>

      <img class="imgboxright" src="Images/Dog.jpg" alt="A Welsh Terrier Puppy" /> <p> Pictured beside, is an image of a
      Welsh Terrier, the same breed of dog that Stuart's childhood pet Scooby was. Scooby had extremely potent
      levels of sass, which helped teach Stuart to not mess with dogs and take care of nature (one could also argue
      that the child-raising techniques utlized by his parents may have also helped accomplish this feat).  Since then,
      Stuart has brought empathy and compasssion to his friends and beyond, even going so far as NOT killing that one
      spider he saw on the wall of his bedroom, although he may or may not regret that decision now. </p>
    <p> Stuart has an INFJ (also known as "The Advocate") personality type.  This means that while being an introvert,
      Stuart cares greatly for others, and helps empower them.  It is also known as the rarest personality type, and
      he wants everyone to know it, but not directly, possibly through some sort of summarization of his life perhaps. </p>
    <p> As Stuart moves into the future, he hopes that he can continue to grow as a person, and learn from those who
      are wiser and more knowledgeable, so he can spread those ideals to those he cares about.  Being one who has
      trouble letting go of the past, Stuart is very much held back by the loss of his friends whose friendship he
      has cherished for anywhere between 3-14 years.  To keep pushing forward he reminds himself that they're not
      gone, just away, and he cannot wait to catch up with them and trade experiences. </p>
