        <h3> Lauren </h3>
        <p> Known to Stuart for 12 years, Lauren is a... unique sort of person.  With years of dance
          training under her belt, she is one of the most flexible people known to all of mankind probably.
          After meeting Stuart in grade one, the two became inseparable, with both of them supporting each other
          through their constant issues.  As a very caring person, Lauren is always looking for chances to
          help others and improve their lives.  She plans on becoming an engineer in the future, which means
          her catchphrase for the next 5 years will be "I can't hang out, I have too much work to do".
          She is currently in a relationship with Shrishan, that almost everyone predicts will turn into a very
          long and happy marriage (no pressure).</p>

        </p>
        <h3> Shrishan </h3>
        <p> After meeting Stuart in grade 10, Shrishan has quickly grown to become one of Stuart's closest friends,
          despite being the most stubborn man to walk the Earth (besides Stuart).  Shrishan is known for having an
          extremely high pain tolerance, which basically affords him the abilities of a minor superhero.  After being
          in the epicentre of a drastic month-long argument with Stuart in grade 11, the two made it a goal to never have
          a large altercation again, which is very similar to a promise Stuart and Lauren made in Grade 6 (this appears to
          be a common theme between Stuart and his friends, coincidence?), this has allowed Shrishan and Stuart to become
          much better friends to one another.  While having technically been in relationship with Lauren for 2 years, Shrishan
          mentally started dating her the moment he met her.  The only complication to this relationship is that Stuart is the
          best friend of both parties involved, so if the break up is nasty then we're gonna have a problem on our hands.</p>

          <img class="imgboxright" id="Justasia" src="Images/Justasia.jpg" alt="Justasia" />
          </p>
          <h3> Justasia </h3>
          <p> Justasia's past with Stuart is slightly tragic.  For the majority of grade 9 Justasia was trying her best to get close to Stuart
            and his friends, but he really just didn't notice (due to his obliviousness).  However, he does remember her being extremely kind,
            and he eventually got to see the extent of her eccentric persosonality when the two became closer, eventually reaching a compatibility
            where the two could be both caring and extremely logical with each other.  Justasia has fantastic percussion skills, reaching the point
            where she was asked to handle around 30 different percussion instruments for a musical production in grade 11 and 12.  She's extremely
            reliable, making it a goal of hers to be on time and prepared for a myriad of situations, despite the twists and turns being friends
            with Stuart comes with.</p>

        <p style="clear:both;">
        <img class="imgboxleft" id="Greg" src="Images/Greg.jpg" alt="Greg" />
        </p>
        <h3> Greg </h3>
        <p> Greg has been Stuart's next door neighbour for 12 years.  The two spent many days in their elementary school years walking to
          school together, eventually running into Lauren and walking with her as well.  Greg has always been a kind person, trying his
          best to make sure that no one ever gets their feelings hurt, and many people appreciate him for that.  After years of piano
          lessons, he has developed an amazing ear for singing and playing various instruments.  His musical capabilities are unparalleled,
          and they only improve with time.  While Stuart and Greg don't talk extremely frequently, when they do get to talking it is simply
          picking up where things left off, it is a very easy-going and strong friendship.</p>

        <p style="clear:both;">
        <img class="imgboxright" id="Monique" src="Images/Monique.jpg" alt="Monique" />
        </p>
        <h3> Monique </h3>
        <p> Monique is a dear friend of Stuart's.  She has become a closer friend ever since she decided to come to Brock and take the same
          program as him.  If it weren't for her, Stuart would be an absolute mess right now with no friends.  She's emphatic and social, always
          up to hang out with people and make some new experiences.  She is very interested in animation, opting to take animation and 3D modelling
          classes in grade 11 and 12 and loving them, which is why he chose a program with the ability to give her the skills she wants.  She is always
          willing to help, especially when someone is in clear distress and in need of help.  She is an amazing singer, as she is able to quickly learn
          and harmonize with songs and people, she truly is an asset and great friend.</p>


        <p style="clear:both;">
        <img class="imgboxleft" id="Max" src="Images/Max.jpg" alt="Max" />
        </p>
        <h3> Max </h3>
        <p> Max is Stuart's oldest known friend, having been his friend for 14 years.  They met in kindergarten and continued on from there, remaining friends throughout
          all their years.  He was one of Stuart's only friends in grade 9, and eventually helped Stuart get close to other people who eventually
          became his friends as well.  Max has a very easy-going personality, much like a gentle giant.  He draws in a variety of different people
          who all eventually get to know him very well. He has an affinity for music, even starring as the role of Shrek in Shrek The Musical, and
          inspring everyone.  He continues to blow everyone away with his list of random facts, and movie knowledge.  He will continue to be
          one of Stuart's close friends for years to come.</p>

        <p style="clear:both;">
        <img class="imgboxright" id="Michelle" src="Images/Michelle.jpg" alt="Michelle" />
        </p>
        <h3> Michelle </h3>
        <p> Michelle's past with Stuart is complex to say the least.  After being in the kindergarten class next door for 2 years
          Michelle transferred to a french immersion school, for 8 years.  She was already close with some of Stuart's other friends,
          but within these 8 years she fell out of touch.  However, when it came to grade 10-12, she became closer and closer to Stuart
          and his friends, once again getting in touch with everyone she'd lost.  From there, she became a very good friend.  Michelle is
          extremely intelligent, getting into top programs across many universities and having any future career open to her.  She loves to
          bake and everyone loves it when she does, because the foods she makes are out of this world.  On top of these talents, she is also
          one of only a few of Stuart's friends who are inherently athletic, which is a commemoration in itself as Stuart doesn't understand
          the whole athletic scene.</p>

        <img class="imgboxleft" id="Ariana" src="Images/Ariana.jpg" alt="Ariana" />
        </p>
        <h3> Ariana </h3>
        <p> Ariana is a great friend of Stuart's, having known him for 3 years.  They both play the alto sax, and have since grown closer due to their
          extensive time spent sitting next to each other in various bands and undergoing a multitude of hijinx.  Ariana and Stuart play off each other
          really well, they have the ability to make any boring moment comedic in the blink of an eye.  Ariana is a fantastic singer, known to perform
          solo many times across her life, especially thriving in concerts in high school.  Stuart and Ariana will remain close friends for years to come,
          as any rough patch they may hit, their flare for the dramatics and history will always bring them together again.</p>
